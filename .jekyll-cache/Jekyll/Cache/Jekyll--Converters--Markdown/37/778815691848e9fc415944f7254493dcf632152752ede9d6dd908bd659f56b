	<h2>Spider-Verse #2</h2>
	<h5>Posted on May 23, 2020 in Marvel</h5>
	<p>The entire SPIDER-VERSE is in trouble including a world where Aunt May got the Spider-Powers (like you saw in SPIDER-GEDDON). But donâ€™t think that this is just a cute and charming story as it introduces some of the scariest villains in Marvel History!!! All this, AND several lucky Spider-Fans bring their Spider-Sonas to the Marvel Multi-Verse!!!</p>
