	<p>Miles Morales finally feels like he GETS this Spider-Man stuff… and then falls through a portal! But isn’t the WEB OF LIFE & DESTINY destroyed? Maybe not, True Believer. But who spun this new web? Regardless, Miles finds himself at the center of a multiversal adventure that will feature a who’s who of creators and characters as the series spins forward! And with a main cover by INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE character designer WENDELL DALIT!!! And each issue features #SPIDERSONAS from some of the biggest Spidey fans and comic creators both!</p>
